                        The reef-bordered seashores and mountains that gloat of beautiful canyons and cascades will be
                        the features of an excursion to Samoa. This nation offers a license on appearance, yet no visa
                        records are required. Plunge into the well-known Togitogiga Waterfall, or snorkel at the
                        Lalomanu Beach. Another must-do thing while in Samoa is to observe local people raising newborn
                        child turtles at the Satoalepai Turtle Sanctuary in Savai’i.
