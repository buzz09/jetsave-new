                        Traveling and exploring the far corners of the planet with no cash sounds like a far off dream,
                        an unimaginable dream. But mind you, it is conceivable, and you can do it without burning up all
                        available monetary resources. It can be said that there are a few costs you shouldn’t compromise
                        on like having compromising on travel insurance, yet there are tons of ways you can travel
                        around to the far corners of the planet in a budget-friendly way.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Travel doesn’t need to be costly at all. With the correct spending plan and the correct outlook,
                        you can make your travel dreams a reality. Regardless of whether you earn or not or have any
                        debts, there are still a lot of ways to come up with a way to travel in the most budget-friendly
                        manner. Your travel then may not be extravagant or luxurious, but if travel comes at the top of
                        your list, then you can get it going!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You don’t need to spend a ton of cash to feel like a jet setting boss while traveling. The trap
                        for traveling this way is a blend of knowing how to get costly amenities for shoddy, while also
                        getting the attitude that guilty pleasures don’t generally need to be costly. While traveling
                        lavishly seems very welcoming, the majority of us are either still in college or just beginning
                        with a job which can make it hard to design a luxurious trip.

                        A ton of us considers get-aways an extravagance thing—something that we need to rampage spend on
                        and go all out, however, there are a lot of ways to have an extraordinary vacation in a
                        budget-friendly limit.

                        In case you’re thinking about how to plan an excursion on a budget without making it, well,
                        lame…don’t stress! There are bunches of budget-friendly options that will guarantee you and your
                        family building sandcastles or going to historical centers or having a good time at an amusement

                        Book a Flight 6-7 Months Prior to the Journey </h3>

                    <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.curiouskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Curious-Keeda-advance-booking.jpg?w=628&ssl=1"

                    <p>
                        Yes, this is one of the most full-proof methods to save a lot of money even before you’ve
                        started out on your adventure. We all know how these last-minute flights can bring out a hole in
                        your pocket and can drastically affect the budget. But, if you plan your trip in advance and
                        book these flight tickets a few months prior to your journey, you not only save a lot of money
                        but are likely to find one suiting your schedule and requirements as well. If you are not that
                        planned person, let Jetsave do it for you! Tell them your requirements and they will get it all
                        in place.

                        Travel Off the Peak Time</h3>
                    <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.curiouskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/curiouskeeda-off-peak-1.jpg?resize=629%2C420&ssl=1"
                        width="100%" height="auto"><br><br>

                    <p>
                        All the official holidays and long weekends might seem like a good option and great times to go
                        on vacation—after all, you are on a break from all the obligations you have, right? But
                        unfortunately, EVERYONE has the same idea and ticket prices skyrocket during these busy
                        weekends. If you want to enjoy your vacation without thinking about how you have crashed your
                        bank balance, then book travel for off-peak times, like the middle of the week. Along with
                        planning it at your home, watch for events that might be happening at your vacation destination.
                        Traveling to New Mexico during their famous International Hot Air Balloon Fiesta can cause much
                        higher prices on hotel stays and airfare.

                        Check for Discounts</h3>
                    <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.curiouskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/curiouskeeda-discount.jpg?w=640&ssl=1"
                        width="100%" height="auto"><br><br>

                    <p>
                        There are a lot of discounts that are available which you do not even have any idea about! A lot
                        of people with specific positions are entitled to many travel discounts. You can get discounts
                        on travel and hotels, and some museums and historical sites offer educator discounts as well.
                        Always ask about student discounts and lower fees for children under 12, under 18, or other
                        options. You might be surprised at just how much you can save. Also, don’t forget to check out
                        the travel planner for your destination and their website for any activities you plan to do.
                        Sometimes discounts and special deals aren’t advertised upfront but can be found online and with
                        a little digging. Jetsave does come up with amazing discounts and offers on flight bookings and
                        stays. Do your homework beforehand and you might just save a bundle!

                        Focus on being active over accommodations</h3>
                    <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.curiouskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/curiouskeeda-places-visitng.jpg?resize=640%2C256&ssl=1"

                    <p>
                        Being all choosy and picky about accommodations can make your trip much more expensive. Most of
                        us don’t go on vacation for the awesome hotel suite, right? If you plan to spend most of your
                        time outside of your hotel room, look for something that’s clean and simple. Opting for a hotel
                        room with basic things that you need for a night’s sleep—a bed, a shower, electrical outlets,
                        and a TV. Fancy suites can be lovely and fun, but outside of honeymooning, there’s really no
                        reason to splurge on accommodations.
                    </p>

                        Invest in a City Tourist Card </h3>
                    <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.curiouskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Curious-Keeda-card.jpg?w=500&ssl=1"

                    <p>
                        Going to the attraction after attraction without worrying about price is something done by two
                        types of people: Those with unlimited funds and those with city tourist cards. In major
                        metropolises around the world, city tourist cards offer tours, admission to attractions,
                        transportation and discounts at select spots for a flat price, usually over a set period of
                        time. Before you buy, compare your costs for admission and transportation for what you want to
                        do and see without the pass, and compare those numbers to the prices of available passes.
                    </p>

                    <p>Traveling doesn’t have to be expensive if you know how to plan and cut the costs and can actually
                        be a great way to experience life</p>
