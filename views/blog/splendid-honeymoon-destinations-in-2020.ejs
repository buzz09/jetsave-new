                    Indonesia has always been a honeymooner’s favorite. It has that exotic appeal that makes it
                    worthy of the occasion yet the luxury of somewhere that will bring that sense of marital bliss.
                    Sequestered in the heart of an undiscovered island paradise, the exclusive Nihi Sumba hugs the
                    white sands of the Indian Ocean to create a remote hideaway. An island deeply-rooted in its
                    culture, there is a spiritual connection to be found here that serves to energize and invigorate
                    even the most laidback of honeymoons. Amid the beautiful, unspoilt landscape, the palm trees
                    reveal a place perfect for any couple, whether they spend their days beneath the surface
                    scuba-diving, rustling up a nasi goreng in a cooking class or exploring local villages and
                    customs on an island tour. This is one somewhere you’ll come for your honeymoon – and every
                    anniversary to follow. <a

                        Croatia has never been a more sought after, or a more romantic, travel destination than in
                        2020. Expect gorgeous Roman ruins, like the fourth-century Diocletian Palace built as a
                        retirement home for the emperor himself, natural spectacles like the seven towering
                        waterfalls of the Krka National Park, and virtually-unchanged medieval villages. Spend the
                        day sailing between Croatia’s beautiful islands, where you can dock for a swim and layout
                        where you like. Go for a stroll along its cobbled streets and soak up its laid-back island
                        vibes. It’s about time that you make your way toward the paradise that is Croatia. Seashores
                        with perfectly clear water combined with stunningly well-safeguarded old towns that are sure
                        to make your trip to Croatia one you’ll never forget.<a
