                        Visas are another document that is designed to allow people access to other countries. Now you
                        may get confused as to why we need a visa when we already have a passport in place. To your
                        knowledge, there is a big difference between a visa and a passport. A visa specifies certain
                        reasons as to why that person will be staying in a foreign country. It also clearly specifies a
                        certain time frame of the stay. Most of the time, visas are granted to people who work or plan
                        to attend some school for higher studies in a nation for a selected amount of time. It acts as a
                        supplement to the passport, as both are required to be present at the same time. The visa is
                        usually stapled or attached to the passport and shown at the time of entry into another country.
                        Just like passports, most visas also have a time limit, and typically that time extends to the
                        maximum of six months. Under certain circumstances, people can also request to get their visas
                        extended, but there are very strict requirements that are to be followed in order to get a time
                        extension. Just like passports, a travel insurance policy is recommended in case the paperwork
                        is misplaced.
