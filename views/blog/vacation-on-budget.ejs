                        We are all crushed under the pressure of our hectic schedules, be it work or studies. Most of us
                        crave for a few days of bliss at a place far from this pressure. While sometimes our work may
                        not allow a vacation, usually it is our wallet that restricts us from taking one. But what if we
                        tell you it is possible, and in a budget that you can easily afford?</p>

                    <p>
                        The most important thing you have to do to ensure a cheap vacation is to plan your budget
                        wisely. Whether you will be going solo or in a group, you have to make sure that there is an
                        amount that you should not be exceeding. Then, accordingly, you can do your research about the
                        places you want to visit and narrow it down to the places that you actually can in the budget.
                        This will include your travelling charges, accommodation charges, food charges and lastly
                        charges for your leisure. You can also do this with the help of several websites like Jetsave
                        that let you filter out the results of your choice, especially money wise so that you can get a
                        better understanding.

                        especially if it is last minute. If you have a larger group of people going with you, it is most
                        likely that the amount on your bills is going to drop significantly. Similarly, even if you are
                        going solo, there are so many last minute deals that you can grab on Jetsave. Be it for
                        accommodation or transportation. And even for food and local transportations, you can rely on
                        Jetsave‘s help in offering you discounts and other deals that can ease off the pressure on your

                        Choose Hotel Alternatives</h3>
                    <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.curiouskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/curiouskeeda4.png?resize=640%2C360&ssl=1"

                    <p>
                        Hotels can be pretty expensive, especially if you are visiting a place attractive to tourists.
                        This means spending more than the necessary amount of money solely on your accommodation, per
                        night. There are several alternatives available, in many cities that cost much less than a
                        hotel. Give, that you may have to give away some of the luxuries, but that’s a small price to
                        pay, literally. One of the best alternatives is to stay with a friend if you are lucky enough to
                        have one in the city. This would mean either spending no money or very less on accommodation if
                        they live as a paying guest, hence making it budget friendly. Moreover, they will be pretty good
                        guides and will give you a better idea of what you can do, whilst spending lesser. Another
                        alternative is living in a hostel, as long as you do not mind sharing it with other travellers.
                        You just have to make sure that your belongings are safe because you never know. Additionally,
                        many people provide their homes as vacation rentals, if they are not in use, and usually, they
                        are not as expensive, either. Moreover, you get that home vibe as well, which is like a cherry
                        on top.

                        Go during the off season</h3>
                    <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.curiouskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/curiouskeeda5-5.jpg?resize=640%2C321&ssl=1"
                        width="100%" height="auto"><br><br>

                    <p>
                        Many places are often very busy during what is called the “tourist season”. This gives the
                        hotels and other tourist-related places to hike their prices and everything ends up being more
                        expensive than necessary. For example, places can be especially busy during the summer, when
                        students have their breaks, and therefore you will find an expensive thing. If you go off
                        season, there are chances that not only will you get services at good prices, a lot of places
                        provide additional discounts as the business runs slow during that time. Going off season can be
                        one of the best decisions you take, also because the places are not too noisy or crowded, which
                        is a huge perk, to be honest.

                        Go Camping!</h3>
                    <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.curiouskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/curiouskeeda6-5.jpg?zoom=0.9375&resize=468%2C311&ssl=1"

                    <p>
                        Camping is always, ALWAYS, cheaper than going on a luxury vacation. As long as you have an idea
                        of what you are doing or you are going with an expert, camping can be the best kind of vacation.
                        Staying amidst nature, being able to see the stars at night and a breath of fresh air is enough
                        to make anyone get that connection to not only nature but with themselves. And if you are lucky
                        enough to lie near camping areas or trekking areas, which most cities have nearby, camping isn’t
                        going to be a hassle for you or your bank account!
