                        is the biggest state in India that packs a conglomerate of cultural and historical treasures,
                        which lends itself to those ones of a kind experience. The state is the ideal amalgamation of

                    Rajasthan is home to the most extreme number of palaces and forts in India. The epic forts and

                <p>
                    Rajasthan’s love for art and culture originates from the antiquated age when Kings used to run the
                    show. In spite of the fact that art and culture are prominent in a lot of Indian cities, Rajasthan
                    singles itself out with its astounding contrast of colors, materials, and texture. Interestingly,
                    Rajasthani folk culture treasures male jewelry as much as the female jewelry – in striking contrast
                    to the rest of the nation. Puppetry is viewed as one of the most significant forms of art in
                    Rajasthan and puppetry craftsmen entrance crowds with their excellent story-telling and mastery.
                    Even in the furthest regions of the desert, you can find brightly lit shops selling bangles,
                    folklore and local textiles of the richest color combinations.

                    adventure or cultural festival. When in Rajasthan, your trip will undoubtedly match with one of its

                    much scary but rather more fun. Rajasthan’s people are traditionally amiable and down to earth and
                    the popular adage, <b> ‘Atithi Devo Bhava‘ </b> (Guest is God) is their culture’s ethos. If you want
