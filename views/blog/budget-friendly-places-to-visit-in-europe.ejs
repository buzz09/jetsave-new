                    If Johnny Depp’s “The Tourist” gave us anything to take back, it’d definitely be the flamboyance of
                    Venice. Venice rightfully sets the mood to delve right into tranquility, with its long stretches of
                    water which will definitely help you sing-song to ‘row, row row your boat’. Venice is the right
                    place for the beauty lover who’d love to immerse himself and swim in bliss. This city on water
                    wouldn’t fail to cast its spell with its serenading violin and romantic gondolas without burning a
                    hole in your pocket. Romance under budget, amazing right? <a

                    Greece is the place to be for all those mythology lovers. With its rugged beauty, spreading across
                    archaic wonders this cradle of democracy slows down the rhythm of life and makes you dance to its

                    Gorgeous blue beaches accompanied by majestic mountains, isn’t this a mini geography book by itself?
                    The astonishment shouldn’t in fact stop there when there exists ‘The Museum of Broken Relationships’
                    which will undeniably leave you gaping. Studded with cobbled streets amidst medieval architecture,
                    this marvel wouldn’t burn a hole in your pockets at the least. Oh and how did I miss? The eternal
                    lasting Game of Thrones was shot here. Adding a cherry to the topping is Croatia’s rich coastline
                    housing major Old Town content for the Old school you! <a

                    London</h3>

                <p>
                    “London Bridge is falling down, My Fair Lady”, Nostalgia strings the bow as we enter this
                    well-structured magnum opus tapping to the age-old rhyme. With its ever running classical theatres
                    with musical plays, and Michelin starred restaurants, London allows you to bask in its history with
                    its no-cost museums singing glories of the past. The Bird-eye view from the ferry wheel if not the
                    London Eye is something to die for if you weren’t yet mesmerized by the Royal parks and massive
                    sporting venues. Painting all these structures well is the River Thames, which gives you the
                    ambiance of a mini Venice putting this fairyland to sleep

                <p>
                    Home to the Berlin Wall, thriving on nightlife and renaissance art pieces, this city’s history has
                    been etched onto our brains. The wholesome experience of music while drowning in draught beer is a
                    must in this cultural paradise. The long stretching exquisitely carved fairytale castles singing
                    songs of glory are a visual retreat for any bystander. <a href="http://journeys.jetsavetours.in/Tour-the-Splendid-Towns-of-Amsterdam"
                        style="color: red;">It might be cliche but visiting Germany</a>
                    during the Oktoberfest will give you the liberation you have been waiting for. The scenic routes
                    along the wine road and German clock road is a must. Do not miss the ride through the Black forest
                    at any cost.

                    the Giralda, take a horse ride down the dusty lanes of the tropical island Mallorca and snorkel in

                    Familia. If you haven’t been impressed yet then visit Spain during its cliche La Tomalina or any
                    Bullfight fest that happens throughout the year.<a href="http://journeys.jetsavetours.in/Tour-the-Epic-Land-of-Spain" style="color: red;"> All of

                    The Grandiose of this country is mind-boggling. Buzz past the Colosseum, dive right into the
                    Sardinia and play with the fire in Sicily. Italy with its twists and turns drives you crazy. If you
                    haven’t yet fallen in love with it then you have to ski past Italian alps. Let loose and wander
                    through the Vatican City, but do not miss to the ancient wonder of Pompeii with the <a
