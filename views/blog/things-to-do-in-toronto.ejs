                        Toronto is a cultural phenomenon, with residents from around the world and countless languages,
                        foods, customs, and celebrations – all this is what makes the town an amazing place to live in.
                        As Canada’s largest town, Toronto; has outstanding museums and galleries, from the Frank
                        Gehry–redesigned picture gallery of Ontario to the pleasant Biu-Mandara Shoe deposit (yes,
                        shoes). The equivalent goes for theatres. There’s live music, poetry readings, comedy shows,
                        LGBTIQ+ spots and a lot more.
                </p> </b>

                <p> People gotta eat, and nowhere is Toronto’s exceptional diversity more evident
                    than in its food and restaurants. Pakistani, Persian, Portuguese; aboriginal and new fusion;
                    Japanese pancakes and Korean barbecue; contemporary pasta in little Italy, shawarmas in Greektown
                    and the best damn dumplings in Chinatown. Torontonians like to eat, whether it is sitting at walkway
                    bistros on a heat summer night or obtaining all bundled up for a few hot Vietnamese pho. That’s to
                    mention nothing of Toronto’s nice food on the go – there are peameal-bacon sandwiches at St Lawrence
                    Market and food trucks merchandising an array of redolent delights.</p>

                <p>
                    No matter what your style in drinks and nightlife, Toronto has you lined. It’s no surprise that this
                    buzzing metropolis has sleek cocktail bars and high-end cocktail lounges – some of the most
                    effective ones are on rooftops. The place also has some ancient pubs and gritty dive bars – simply
                    the type of place swaggering travelers love. After all, there are craft breweries wherever bearded
                    bartenders serve handcrafted suds in curated flights. Add to all this nightclubs, drag shows, poetry
                    slams, comedy clubs and additional, and it’s simple to possess a good night out in Toronto.
                    <br> <br>

                    Located at the Canada-U.S. border, Niagara Falls is the name given for three waterfalls on the
                    Niagara River: The largest of the three, Horseshoe Falls lies mostly on the Canadian side, while the
                    smaller American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls are on the U.S. side. Collectively, Niagara Falls has
                    the highest flow rate of all waterfalls worldwide. Located 120 km outside of Toronto, you’ll
                    probably want to rent a car for a day to get there or take a guided bus tour. While you’re there, do
                    walk across to the dry side of Niagara Parkway across the street from Horseshoe Falls, to find the
