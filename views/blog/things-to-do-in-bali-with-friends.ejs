                        The waterfalls are a big drawcard in Bali. You’ll find that some are more crowded than others.
                        Finding the quieter ones will require a little more research and probably travel a little
                        further around the island. But the popular touristy ones such as the Tegenungan waterfall are
                        popular for a reason and are well worth a visit. Arrive early morning to avoid the crowds and be
                        patient if you want to get a tourist-free shot of you in the waterfall. Locals will tell you
                        friends who swim together will separate, so enter at your own risk. There are also plenty of
                        other waterfalls to explore.
