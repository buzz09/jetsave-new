                        vacation,</b> <i> but we
                        just cannot find the time to plan one amidst our busy schedules. Planning a vacation takes a
                        lot of time and effort. Planning a vacation does not mean that you just think and head
                        straight to the airport, it involves a lot of things. From choosing the perfect location,
                        scouring reviews, researching the hotel, asking friends for referrals, ordering your Lonely
                        Planet guide, booking excursions ensuring you see all that your perfect location has to
                        offer. </i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All this combined takes hours and hours of time! Time is that elusive creature you can never get
                        your hands on. Just when you think you’re closing in, it takes off once again out of your reach.
                    </p>

                        <b> <i> What I think is, vacation is meant to be relaxing.

                        If you find yourself stuck in this big vicious circle, cue towards a guided group tour operator
                        just like Jetsave. They are always on their toes to curate tour packages with amazingly crafted
                        itineraries for the labelled busy who’d rather be traveling and exploring. Companies like
                        Jetsave, bring together excursions, stay, meals, and more to wrap up into one, easy package
                        topped with a pretty glimmering bow.
                        <br> <br>
                        The main contributor to this massive change is the ever-evolving internet which is constantly
                        changing the world. It is the one which has brought in infinite possibilities along with
                        empowering people. Due to this change people now actively ask for the exact thing they are
                        looking at, and if they don’t get it, they can search for a better alternative.
                        <br> <br>
                        Consumers have now turned out on being more demanding. They can simply search for the same offer
                        in dozens, or even hundreds, of retail and reservations websites with simple mouse clicks in a
                        matter of minutes. All possible information is spread everywhere, and consumers are more
                        educated than ever. The time when the consumers just have to accept whatever was being offered
                        to them is now over!
                        <br> <br>

                        Now with the shifted sales focus to accommodate a significant request for private and exclusive
                        custom trips. Opportunities can easily turn into problems.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>“It is very different, creating a new custom trip than taking a booking on an existing
                            scheduled
                            trip,” said Jetsave expert. “It’s more internal. We also need to be sure to get our staff in
                            the
                            field often. They can sell a scheduled departure without seeing it, but when it comes to
                            customs
                            and FITs firsthand experience is key.” </b>

                        <i> For a tour operator, shifting from print, brochure-like product to a custom package is like
                            a
                            classical dancer moving from classical to hip-hop. </i>

                        Creating a custom trip begins with a question/answer session for the purpose of narrowing down
                        possibilities to a realistic plan that satisfies the wants and needs of the family or group.
                        Then the tour planner, with the help of the various specialists in the company and its network
                        of partners, can put together a plan that works. No one in the world knows better than the
                        clients themselves what they want. But the tour experts of Jetsave having years of experience
                        and knowledge are always there to show what is available and what is possible.</p>

                    <p>“As creative as our set itineraries are, many want to modify a few activities or craft the week
                        into a completely different private trip,” said Jetsave travel expert. “We love the challenge.”

                    <p style="text-align: center;"> <b> Now that you know that custom tours are possible, here are some

                    <p>
                        When it comes to the topic of residency, a visa is important for the host country to
                        determine who qualifies to permanently reside within their borders. It also allows a
                        nation’s immigration department to decide when a permanent resident can become a citizen,
                        and when the foreign national first arrived is an important part of the citizenship process.

                        The best thing about many tour packages is that all your breakfasts and dinners are included, or
                        optional extras can be selected, where you have the privilege of adding things based on your
                        preferences. You now no more have to search for places in an unknown land that serves food of
                        your choice. Along with that, you have an added bonus, as you would have your tour guide along,
                        someone who has tried all the delicacies before can suggest you some of the best things to try
                        in that alien land! All this instantly take away the panic of “where is it safe to eat” or “how
                        will it taste?”.

                    <p>
                        When in an unknown land, there is no guarantee of your safety. But, having a customized tour
                        gives you the added benefit of safety in numbers. Travelling with an experienced company and
                        manager who is fluent in the local culture and practices is reassuring. It allows travellers to
                        sideline their worries, and simply enjoy their vacation.
                    </p>
