                    the whole world. Cinque Terre has been ingeniously constructed out of five fishing villages and is a
                    UNESCO World Heritage Site since the year of 1997. The beautiful paths traverse cliffs which are
                    seemingly impregnable. A nineteenth-century railway line which has been cut through a range of
                    coastal tunnels ferries the footsore traveller from one village to another. To one’s delight,
                    vehicles were banned in this little village over a decade ago.
