                        less

                    flying into Brussels rather than Paris). Kartik said this works especially well for increasingly off
                    the beaten destinations — for instance, if you want to go to one of the Greek Islands, think about
                    flying into Athens first.

                    Kartik said one of the worst things you can do is hold up until the last minute of your travel as it
                    is well known that the prices in general skyrocket near the booked flight. Rather, he said to look
                    to book in the contrasting season from when you need to travel (book flights in the summer to travel
                    in the winter and book flights in the winter to leave throughout the summer).

                        perhaps
                        somewhat more if you want to go during summer or Christmas, New Year’s,” </b> Kartik stated, yet
                    added
                    that even better than that is to <b>“begin looking for flights and hotels around the New Year for
                        September, November. As soon as the prices slope down, I’m going to book it, but when you’re
                        almost
                        like 11 months out, I will be increasingly patient. You have got a lot of time…it’s smarter to
                        have
                        10 months from when you need to fly as opposed to two months — you can be choosy.” </b>

                    maybe just looking to explore and investigate some lesser-known destinations in Europe if a cheap

                    setting your heart to one place… see where the cheap flights spring up. It’s sort of a shift in your

                    Kartik brought up that airlines, particularly budget ones, regularly charge expenses for things like
                    seat selection and baggage (sometimes these charges are even per leg of a flight or the connecting
                    flights) and it’s very important to know precisely what you’ll need to pay for.

                        you book a
                        flight in case you’re almost certain you will need to check a bag, explore at the costs to
                        upgrade
