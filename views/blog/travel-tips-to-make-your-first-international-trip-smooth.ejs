                        Foreign Country Entry Requirements</h3>

                    <p>Entry necessities will probably contrast depending on your destination and home country. A few
                        places may simply acknowledge your passport, while others may require a visa. To ensure you have
                        the right documentation, visit the embassy’s website to see what is required.
                        <br> <br>
                        Visas: If you do require a visa, you should acquire this from the relevant foreign consular
                        agent before you can visit the preferred country.
                        <br> <br>
                        Work and Residency Permits: If you’re planning on working in the nation you are making a trip
                        to, you should verify whether you’ll require any special documentation to do this.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Tip 3#<br>
                        Taking Money Abroad</h3>

                    <p>There are various ways you can take cash with you abroad, and it’s ordinarily worth combining a
                        few of these strategies.</p>

                    <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.curiouskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Credit-card-Debit-card-and-Cash.jpg?w=548&ssl=1"
                        width="100%" height="auto"><br><br>

                    <p>
                        <b> Credit Cards:</b> These are ideal for larger purchases such as restaurant meals, car
                        rentals, hotel
                        bills and airline tickets. You’ve also got the added bonus of gaining travel points with many of
                        these cards.
                        <br>
                        <b> Debit Cards: </b> Again, these types of cards can often provide you with good exchange
                        rates. With a
                        lot of ATMs available all over the world, withdrawing cash in the local currency can be easy.
                        <br>
                        <b> Cash: </b>It’s also worth carrying some cash on you when you’re traveling abroad, just in
                        case the
                        establishment you’re visiting doesn’t accept cards or checks. If you’re staying a long way from
                        a town, having some cash to get by until you visit there again will be helpful.
                        <br>
                        <b> Traveler’s Cheques and Prepaid Cards:</b> These are a secure alternative to cash, and are
                        perfect as
                        a backup if you can’t find an ATM or the one nearest you is out of service. If these are lost or
                        stolen, they can normally be replaced within 24 hours.
                    </p>

                    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Tip 4#<br>
                        Flip through your Passport</h3>

                    <p>
                        Ensure that a little blue (or green, red, or dark) book is up to date. All identifications
                        should be legitimate for as long as a half year from your leave date in the country, and should
                        have at least two blank pages. Make a copy of the page that has your photograph and complete
                        name on it, and keep these duplicates in safe spots—at the base of your bag in various pieces of
                        luggage, or even with various people who may be going with you. Leave one copy of your
                        identification at home, with coworkers if on a work trip, and to avoid potential risk, leave one
                        with an emergency contact.
                    </p>

                    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Tip 5#<br>
                        Figure out your phone plan</h3>

                    <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.curiouskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/phone-plan-to-be-fixed.jpg?resize=640%2C360&ssl=1"
                        width="100%" height="auto"><br><br>

                    <p>
                        Research phone plans in other countries, and see if it’s cheaper to get a local SIM card and use
                        a new number and carrier service, or shell out for an international roaming plans. If you’re
                        only going on a short trip, or looking to save money, turn your phone on Airplane mode and use
                        Wi-Fi to call via Skype or WhatsApp.
                    </p>

                    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Tip 6#<br>
                        Read the Fine Print on your Medical Insurance</h3>

                    <p>
                        Connect with your medical insurance provider and inquire as to whether your policy covers abroad
                        crises. If the response is no, think about to what extent you’ll be gone for, what you’ll be
                        doing, and adding extra coverage through supplemental insurance plans.
                    </p>

                    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Tip 7#<br>
                        Dive deep into the world of adapters and converters</h3>

                    <p>
                        You must charge that phone, after all, and not all fittings are alike. Research sockets in the
                        places you’re visiting, and invest in adapters or convenient chargers that can be charged off of
                        your laptop via USB.
                    </p>

                    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Tip 8#<br>
                        Make Extra Copies of your Passport and Important Documents</h3>

                    <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.curiouskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/photocopying.png?resize=640%2C247&ssl=1"
                        width="100%" height="auto"><br><br>

                    <p>
                        Don’t forget to e-mail a copy to yourself too. You never know when you might need to have some
                        sort of documentation with you and might not want to carry your original. Additionally, if your
                        passport gets stolen having a copy will come in handy for your police report.
                    </p>

                    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Tip 9#<br>
                        Learn basic phrases in the native language of your destination</h3>

                    <p>
                        The locals will appreciate it and it will make your interactions easier. You don’t need to
                        master the language but learning a few things like “Hello,” “Goodbye,” “Thank you!”, “Where’s
                        the bathroom?” will go a long way to endearing yourself with the locals. They’ll like that you
                        tried.
                    </p>

                    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Tip 10#<br>
                        Lunchtime is the Best Time to Visit Historical Sites</h3>

                    <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.curiouskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/travel-tips-curiouskeeda.jpg?resize=640%2C237&ssl=1"
                        width="100%" height="auto"><br><br>

                    <p>
                        Be a contrarian. You’ll have fewer crowds getting in your way as big tour buses, groups, and
                        most travelers head to lunch. It’s always best to visit an attraction super early, late, or when
                        people eat. You’ll have even the most popular places to yourself!
                    </p>

                        Part of the fun of traveling is the sense of adventure that stems from facing the unknown as we
