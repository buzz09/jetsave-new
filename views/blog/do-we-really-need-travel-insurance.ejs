                            would actually be travelling. This lets the traveler pay only what should be intended and
                            not give away extra bucks. This being said, the traveler also usually gets an option to
                            extend the insurance, if the trip is being elongated. It is to be noted that the person
                            might not have to pay anything extra if the insurance prevails and therefore hasn’t expired,
                            which usually turns out to be a pretty beneficial situation for the person.
