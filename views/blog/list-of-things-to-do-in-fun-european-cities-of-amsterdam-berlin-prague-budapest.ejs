                    This evolving and living craftsmanship/art display used to simply be a plain old wall, with no
                    perceiving highlights by any stretch of the imagination. During the 1980s however that all began to
                    change after John Lennon was killed and his impact transformed into motivation. While it is
                    continually changing under layers of new paint, the standards consistently remain Love and harmony.
