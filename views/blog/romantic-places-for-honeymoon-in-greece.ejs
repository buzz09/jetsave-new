                        width="100%" height="auto">

                    <p>One of the only honeymoon destinations in southeastern Europe where you can go through your early
                        morning walk by venturing into the 5th century and your night by absorbing the city views at the
                        rooftop bars, Athens is easily one of the most diverse cities in Greece. While most travelers
                        make a beeline Acropolis, old remnants from Greece’s past, consider beginning your Athens trip
                        by seeing the splendor of this wonderful site by climbing to the highest point of Areopagus
                        Hill, another historical site that flaunts stunning views. There’s history around each corner:
                        Sports fans should swing by Panathenaic Stadium to get a look at where the first modern Olympic
                        Games were held in 1896. History buffs, then again, will enjoy getting a closer look at the
                        Parthenon. History and architecture aside, experience the color and culture of the city at
                        rebetiko venues in the Gazi locale for good music and even better cocktails.</p>
