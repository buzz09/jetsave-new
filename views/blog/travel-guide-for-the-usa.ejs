                        New York City</b> </h4>

                <p>
                    New York City is one of those places that can be something to everyone. It is perfect for a fun
                    escape, rejuvenating getaway, or a solo trip. There are so many things to do in New York City that
                    people keep going back time and time again to see the city in a completely different light. With an
                    efficient transportation system and an endless list of sights for any budget, New York City is one
                    of the best cities in the US to travel alone.

                <h4 style="text-align: center;"> <b> 2|<br>
                        Las Vegas</b> </h4>

                <p>
                    Las Vegas is not a place which can be synonymized with great natural landscapes, but there is no
                    tour surrounding the national parks and scenery of the Southwest that would be complete without a
                    days visit to the spectacular casinos of The Strip – the main road through this energetic desert
                    city. Apart from having tons of man-made attractions, Las Vegas serves to a great base or a starting
                    point from which to explore this part of America.

                    is the place to go. Museums and galleries are perfect for solo travel, and you can take your time
                    exploring whichever one piques your interest.

                    give yourself plenty of time to explore. If you’re after glamour, bustle and excitement, Los Angeles

                <h4 style="text-align: center;"> <b> 5|<br>
                        San Francisco </b> </h4>

                <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.curiouskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/san-fransico.jpg?resize=640%2C359&ssl=1"
                    width="100%" height="auto"><br><br>

                <p>
                    San Francisco is often termed to be “Everybody’s Favorite City,” a title that is earned because of
                    its scenic beauty, cultural attractions, diverse communities, and world-class cuisine. This walkable
                    city is spotted with milestones like the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, cable cars and the biggest
                    Chinatown in the United States. A walk around the City’s roads can lead from Union Square to North
                    Beach to Fisherman’s Wharf, with charming neighborhoods to investigate every step of the way.
                    Perspectives on the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay are regularly bound with mist, making a
                    sentimental state of mind in this generally European of American urban areas.

                <h4 style="text-align: center;"> <b> 6|<br>
                        Niagara </b> </h4>

                <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.curiouskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/niagara-falls.jpg?resize=640%2C359&ssl=1"
                    width="100%" height="auto"><br><br>

                <p>
                    The spot is formed at the U.S./Canada border right from the city of Niagara Falls up to Lake
                    Ontario. The waterfalls are 170 to 180 feet tall, however Horseshoe Falls is more than twice as wide
                    as American Falls. When at the American side of the falls, you will land at Niagara Falls State
                    Park, stop at the Visitor Center to get the lay of the land. From that point you can visit the
                    Observation Tower, head over to Discovery Center and the Niagara Aquarium, walk or drive onto Goat
                    Island or purchase a ticket for one of the brave voyages through the falls. Anybody hoping to find a
                    workable pace individual with the deafening falls should make the excursion to the Cave of the
                    Winds. The falls are amazing to such an extent that approaching the Hurricane Deck resembles
                    encountering a typhoon.
